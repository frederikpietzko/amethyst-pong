# Notes

## Amethyst so far
- more complicated than bevy
    - but I think not in a bad way.
- I really like state concept so far.
    - State is managed by events as far as I understand it.
    - I think Events are dispatched somehow.
    - but I am maybe a bit biased because i like event based systems.

## ECS
- I am not sure I reallt understand why ECS is supposed to be better than plain OO for gamedev
- I dont really grasp the concept yet.
    - Possibly because i havent fully understood Rust yet.
    - That may resolve itself with Time when I better understand Rusts features.
        - (Witch on a side note find to be quite different than other languages I explored in the past or use on a daily basis like
         Java, Python, Typescript)
